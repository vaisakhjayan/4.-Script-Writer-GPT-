    "\"It's nuts!\" Fury over Prince Harry & Meghan Markle plot to make Archie & Lilibet working royals": "Breaking right now, Meghan Markles as ever is being exposed in the leftwing American media just as she posts another picture of her brand. So excited for all the good to come. Running into the weekend like I mean Britney from the Royal News Network. We shouldn't be running into the weekend like I've screwed up my own brand. Oh my gosh, this brand is such an epic disaster. And running into the weekend, like she's done like two or three weekend posts now. And I still wonder why. And where are her products? We have this as ever social media profile that never ever features her products. It just features very curated images, weird food puns, and sort of like kind of cheesy sayings. And and that's about it. What is the brand? What does the brand stand for? I still have zero idea. And it makes it impossible to buy into anything because I have no clue what I'm buying into because there's nothing there. Her running into the ocean. Great. I can do that, too. Like what is as ever? I still don't know. And there is no product. I mean, and and and by the way, every day, Britney, we get new teasers about, oh, actually, it's going to be fashion. Oh, no, it's going to be rosé wine. The latest is it's going to be hospitality. We're going to be able to go and stay in a Megan Markle hotel. This is the most confusing, complicated, deranged, and as a result, I would argue failed brand launches in lifestyle history. I mean, it really has to be. I just can't fathom why Megan just doesn't start out small. Like, I went through and I actually looked a bit at the history of Goop and it started off as a newsletter. It was just a newsletter for a period of years. Then it started, I think, doing sort of affiliate style linking and had a website where it would connect people to products that were already on the market that Gwennneth and others at Goop liked. And then it sort of grew into Goop creating its own product. So they have a beauty line, they have a fashion line. Like you have to start small and you have to prove your concept works. Megan has had one launch. That's it. for a a small number of products. I think the quantities itself were very very very very small and she couldn't really gain any information from that because I think the product sample was way too small. Like I got no I mean I have the hibiscus tea right here. I never got any follow-up email about how good any of the products were. Although I did a video saying that most of it was pretty mediocre to awful. But the whole thing is just it's just nothing. She needs to, I think, stick with the core instead of doing hotels, which requires a huge amount of capital. Rosé Wine, which we've heard for a long time, and then whatever the heck else she's doing. This is all over the place. And you'll see this constantly with companies. Those that overexpand too rapidly tend to collapse pretty quickly, too. Of course. Of course they will. Now, Britney, what is devastating though for Megan Markle is that despite the fact that she's really tried to keep the trade press in America on side over this very complicated launch and failed launch, they're starting to turn and they're turning in a big way. Park is now and that's Puk one of the most respected Hollywood fashion lifestyle newsletters in the industry and they are just out with a big expose into who they have described as the real housewife of Monteito. I want to go through this with you Britney because this is very deeply reported stuff but what's critical too is this is coming from a company Britney that is naturally going to be aligned with Meghan Markle these people are woke they're Hollywood types they believe in her type of work and even they are looking at this and just seeing car crash so let's go through this Britney jump in if you want to at any point because um there's a lot of Interesting revelations. So Park reports no one really knows what's going on with As Meghan Markle's lifestyle brand, which launched last month with an underwhelming selection of faux country high lunch fair, jam, tea, flour, sprinkles, etc. in loose concert with her derisable Netflix show with love Megan. On Tuesday, the Duchess of Sussex announced on her podcast Confessions of a Female Founder that As ever was on pause. Hours later, she posted an Instagram story informing her 3 million followers that there would be a restock later this month. She urged them to sign up to find out details and timings. Last week, Fast Company reported that Me that Maler will announce new products during quarter 1 of 2026 and that the founder wants to really focus on the hospitality angle. As Eva's actual plans, meanwhile, remain unclear. Sorry, Britney. Come in. No, I was just going to say it's it's absolutely crazy her flip-flopping on explaining what the brand is. Obviously, we can see there's a huge inconsistency in her communication and that comes from Megan, her PR company, despite, I'm sure, trying to help her. She can't communicate her brand very well. That's clear. And I also say she tells people to sign up for her email, but the last people she really informed about the launch were the people on the email list. So, if you were hoping that being on the email list, Megan would give you like first dibs, that that's sort of absolutely incorrect. She sent it 15 minutes after the launch of the website with the products on it. Totally. Total mess. And what's so funny is Puck Buck describes her her products, Britney, and I love this. It's the best description of them I've heard. A sad mix of white label pantry items like a jam that my grandmother might have stolen from a twostar hotel. Now then they get to the juice. Okay, so that's the setup. Now they get to the juice. One person who knows Markle intimately described the haphazard roll out and disorganized pivot as simply quote the Sussex way. I'm told the product scarcity was always part of the plan and that Markle wanted everything to sell out within the day to create the illusion of demand. In reality though, the company probably either produced too few units or was opaque about selling out. Maybe both. The Duchess made sure to note in the story that Netflix wasn't just funding the venture, but the truth is that as ever wouldn't exist without the streamer. So, it gets worse. Britney, I heard that Markle doesn't even employ an actual team. She's not building a lifestyle empire. The insider said there's no one that works for the brand. She's outsourced the entire brand to Netflix. They send samples and she picks what she likes. She's being exposed. I I totally believe that in in the Fast Company article, it was sort of interesting because the woman who's sort of head of content at Netflix, I I can't remember her name off the top of my head, but she was talking about how she was watching Megan do something and and Megan's talked about this, too, and told Megan, \"Oh, you're making jam. There's a show there.\" So the show idea is from Netflix. I'm sure the whole line of products is from Netflix. And so she really has put very little effort into this brand. And unfortunately for Netflix, she's not even a good spokesperson for the brand or even a good a good face for it. And so it's like they chose her to be their lifestyle like person to help them enter the lifestyle space. I'm sorry. There's probably a million women you could find on Instagram or Tik Tok who are doing this same thing but a million times better. And to say that this chaotic disaster is the Sussex way is just like just begs the question, why does anybody subscribe to actually investing in Megan? Like chaos is not how you run a business. You you have to have a space for inspiration, but you need to have a plan. If you don't have a plan, you're just going to end up with an epic disaster, which is exactly what we've seen for As ever. I'm sure she did use scarcity tactics to try to drum up interest, but the problem is she waited too long to restock. So, I'm sure she'll sell out again, but will it take longer? Will be shorter? Will the products be better? Who knows? Like, so many questions exist out there. And remember to Tina Nolles, it it was like, \"Oh, no. It's terrible. It's it's terrible.\" Like, you you'd only do the scarcity thing if you were launching sneakers. It's like, \"No, Megan, we know that that's what you wanted to do and that's why you're trying to defend it.\" Yeah. And it makes no sense. Luxury brands can do that. I'm sorry, but tease and like that that it doesn't work. Different different totally different product category. So, Pucks Reporting went on and it's brutal. This is why I'm so fascinated by it. Britney, to be honest, I've always thought Marco was punking us with this brand, which was once called American Riviera Orchard for a Blip. Everything about it reads like a lazy short-term solution to get something out there and into customers hands. Loosely timed to the Duchess's Netflix series, it includes little of the vision or personality of Goop or Martha Stewart or the other lifestyle brands that Megan had the delusions of building. Indeed, it maps the Sussex way. Not fully thought out, hastily executed, prone to pivot. The least that Megan could have done was better time the launch of As Ever to the premiere of With Love Megan. Still, I never expected the roll out of As to be this bad. Also, an industry type recently pointed out that As Ever's logo bears a striking resemblance to the iconography of Flamingo Estate's original logo, except with hummingbirds instead of flamingos. In fact, before she decided to create American Riviera Orchard As If Marco was in advanced talks with Flamingo Estate about an investment in the company, Megan had watched as others leveraged their celebrity to launch lifestyle brands and seemingly wanted in. She had a hard time understanding that other people were having success when she couldn't find her footing, said this person who knows Marl intimately. For Marl, it was, I'm not going to add to their success. I want a piece of my own. According to this person, the duchess has passed on so many opportunities to invest and be more behind the scenes, not only with Flamingo Estate, but also Oak Essentials, the beauty line spun out of Jenny Ka that last year raised close to $10 million ahead of an Ultra Beauty launch. Markle has proven she's incredibly effective at selling other brand stuff, but that doesn't mean she can do it when it's her name on the label. She may influence the purchase of a J Crew sweater, but would the same person buy as ever knitwear. There was the thought that she could dominate any space she decided to get into, the insider added. But she doesn't want to be accessible. Marl, it seems, wants to be an ethereal Monteito queen, the person continued, but isn't willing to commit in the way Gwennneth was. In the sense where Gwennneth was like, I don't care if you're poor and can't afford this. Get in or get out. And so Britney, that person with intimate knowledge of Megan has just spilled and absolutely is what we've been saying about why As ever is a disaster. But first, we've been told our whole lives that wrinkle creams were the easiest way to look younger. Now, one doctor says that's nothing but old news. According to Dr. John Lake, the worldrenowned Beverly Hills beauty expert. Most wrinkle fixes on the market are actually nothing but glorified moisturizers. They hardly make a dent on your appearance. Some can even be harmful to your skin, he said. Now, recently, Dr. Lake has focused his attention away from mainstream cosmetic practices. Why? So that he can pursue a revolutionary anti-aging breakthrough, one that some experts say could empty the wallets of the cosmetic industry. He says it's almost like Photoshop for your face, and you may even be mad after seeing how easy it is to visibly erase your wrinkles from view. His personal clients have dubbed his new do-it-yourself technique, the age rewinder method, because it can take years or even decades off your appearance in under 2 minutes. So, in light of this amazing breakthrough, Dr. Lake has released a step-by-step video to the public. It is free and uninterrupted, where he outlines exactly how to use this simple solution from home. And he says if this helps even one person look younger or feel more confident, he will be thrilled knowing he helped. The video's gone viral. It started on Facebook. There's been well over 2 million view now views now. And I mean women all around the world, thousands of women actually are reporting they look decades younger. One commented, \"Best results of anything I've used. I can't believe how well this works. I'll never stop using this. I don't understand how it works, but the results are great. Thank you.\" So, you can find out more about this yourself right now at bhmd1.com/outspoken or just click on the link in the description box below. That's probably easy, but let me repeat the address. Bhmd the number one.com/outspoken. Dr. Lake does ask one thing from his viewers.

This whole brand is just a chaotic mess. The rollout was chaotic. All the products, I think, are haphazard. They you can just tell that not a lot of thought was put into this. And this goes even back to last year. Megan says she's been working on this for a year. Well, I I don't really see the end results. Like I have several of the products. I saw mistakes on some of the labels and I saw like most of it I would say is cheap. And so she's attempting I think to be sort of this like luxury food brand, I guess, but like her stuff was at best simply mediocre. It wasn't that good. And you can tell she's not investing in the brand because she's not posting anything about the brand on as ever the Instagram account. She should be showing and like doing reals and showing how to use the teas and interesting ways and how she came up with the idea and then how to use the raspberry spread in different recipes. Like she refuses to do the barebones basics of selling a lifestyle brand which is actually to show the products you want people to purchase. Because yes, if she devotes and creates a small batch, sure, it probably will sell out, but unfortunately that that doesn't mean it's all that successful because you had to maybe pay more for overhead than you would otherwise. And so, you won't make that much at the end. I would argue for that initial launch, she probably hardly made anything to be quite honest. She had such a limited batch. And so, at this point, I just don't see where this company is going. And without a firm vision, Megan, I think, is just heading straight for disaster. And she has all the resources in the world to make this a good brand. But she refuses to help. I'm not surprised at all that she has no team for this. She keeps saying like cuz they did like a third person happy anniversary post from the team at of as ever. And I'm like, but who's on the team? We have no clue who's at the company, who's running it. We have no clue. So it's like there is nobody. What's so interesting about this, isn't it, Britney, because we actually know who's running it. It's Ted Sarandos's lot. It's Netflix. And what's so fascinating, Britney, and this is what's particularly mortifying really when you look at what Park's done. Actually, this is just what Netflix does with like Bridgetton and Squid Game. It's just like, let's launch some products off the back of a show. Like, it's not creating a brand. So, Megan has got this so wrong yet again. And if she really thinks this is her ticket to becoming a billionaire, delusional is the word. Now look, I wanted to move on to this other really, really fascinating story this week, which I think has been a little bit underplayed, Britney, because there's been so much else going on. And it all spawned from this revelation in the mail on Sunday that Prince Harry had had a discussion with Charles Spencer about changing his family name back to Spencer, his mother, Diana's last name. Now, this was actually something that was first revealed on my former show on GB News by Tom Bower like 2 years ago. And so, this is how long the discussions have been going on for. But it was in the briefing. Actually, let's just watch. Let's just have a watch actually what Tom Bower told me at the time, Britney, because it's worth looking at. That her real object in life was to be Diana. That has always been her passion. That has also been Harry's passion. And Megan went to the extent of suggesting that they should drop the name Windsor and take the surname Spencer. So she'd be Megan Spencer, the new Diana. And I So this is a plan that they have actively discussed. They've actively discussed it not only by themselves, but with others too. This isn't something that's plucked only in their minds. They were actively trying to recast themselves as Diana and Megan Spencer. And that is so he would go from Harry Windsor to Harry Spencer too his mother's name but that would be a devastating but that is his father. Absolutely. It's all about the breakoff and they would also have given up the Sussex title because you got the new incarnation of Diana. So it actually first came from that revelation from Tom Bower. But it shows you Britney how long these discussions have been going on, how serious they are. And what was so interesting is that in the wake of the male's reporting, the Sussex's actually briefed what they considered really to be going on to the Guardian. But it meant that there's this new revelation that Harry actually believes that Archie and Lily will one day return to work as working royals for the royal family. It's nuts. Obviously, I wanted to play you before we talk about it, Britney. The Sidley twins reacting to this revelation from Richard Eden on the Daily Mail's uh Palace Confidential Watch. Harry wanted the HRes for the children to be included in their passports. And according to this report in the Guardian, he wants their children to have the option um when they're older of being full-time working royals. He wants them to be able to choose. So even though Harry and Megan have quit royal duties, you know, and they're now making twerking videos and everything, they want Princess Prince Archie and Princess Lily to be potential royals in the future that could play an active part in the British royal family. You know, it takes your breath away. What? I had like Katya's face when I first saw this. I was flabbergasted. Flabbergasted. You go to all that trouble of throwing the royal family under the bus, treating the queen horribly for the last year of her life, coming out with an Oprah interview while Prince Phillip was on his deathbed. But you want to now give your children the option the option to go back there and Tyler Perry won't even go there. We we we can't even get Tyler Perry to walk in there around around those people. Tyler Perry said those people. I'm not gonna be around those people. But in the UK is Venezuela. Isn't Betty Isn't Betty his godaughter? Wouldn't he try to intervene at that point and go, \"Why would you guys want them to have the option of going back to a racist institution?\" But why would you want HR on their passports? And then this is my question. What makes you think the future king is going to go, \"Oh, yeah. Do you think your kids want to be full-time royals?\" What? I think King My theory on King Charles, though, is still the same. I think he promised his mother to go easy on Harry. I think I I I just have this feeling about it because she has a soft spot for Harry. She always did. I mean, Britney, the whole story is extraordinary. What's your take? Well, I mean, Harry's idea that somehow anybody would like, especially William, because it' most likely be William who would be king once Archie and Lily became adults, that William is just twiddling his thumbs thinking, you know, and Archie and Lily come up and go, \"We want to serve you.\" And William's like, \"Yes.\" I mean, to be quite frank, it's it's sort of idiotic. It it makes zero sense. At this point, Harry has taken himself out of the equation and by extension his children, too. And so that Harry still, I don't think, fully understands the consequences of his decisions is still rather startling. But I mean, he just even has to look at his cousins, Beatatric and Ejeny, who granted I think should maybe be working royals, but they're not, and they still have HR princess titles. So, why on earth does he think his kids are going to be working royals? I mean, even William has said he thought that Charlotte and Louis might have to get actual jobs and not be working royals, which I think is a complete mistake. I think they'll have to be working royals. But it's like what what is Harry on? Like that ship has well and truly sailed at this point. I don't know what in on earth he is thinking except for he's still living in the land of delusion. Oh, yes he is. Oh, yes he is. And nothing's going to change on that front.
